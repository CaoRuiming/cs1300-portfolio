    <h1 id="iterative-design-writeup">Iterative Design Writeup</h1>
    <p>In this project, I worked in a group with 3 other UI/UX students. We took a startup&#39;s concept and created desktop website designs for that startup using an
      iterative design process.</p>
    <p>We chose to create a laptop/desktop-friendly website for Strive School, a startup educational institution that
      aims to be the Lambda School of Europe.</p>
    <p>Here&#39;s a short description of Strive School from <a
        href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/?guccounter=1">Y
        Combinator&#39;s Summer 2020 Demo Day 1</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Strive School is building a Lambda School for Europe, leveraging income-share agreements to train software
        engineers who don't pay for the education until they get a job in the industry. Once a graduate lands a role,
        the ISA terms charge the person 10% of salary for four years with a maximum total of &euro;18,000.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With this company blurb in mind, we had the following <strong>main goals for our website</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Communicate the unique business model and curriculum of Strive School to prospective students</li>
      <li>Allow interest prospective students to easily create Strive School accounts and begin the admissions process
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>While creating the prototype and high-fi mock up of the website, we deliberately avoided looking at the
      startup&#39;s existing website so that we independently make our own design.</p>
    <p>Our target audience was prospective students who were interested in starting software development careers without
      having to commit to traditional 4-year degrees. Thus, we did not include interfaces for enrolled students in our
      prototypes.</p>
    <h2 id="sketching-and-wireframing">Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
    <p>First, each group member made quick sketches of possible designs for the website. Each set of sketches included
      the following pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Home Page</strong>: includes company introduction, catchy stats, link to admissions page/process</li>
      <li><strong>Admissions Page</strong>: details admissions process, deadlines, includes link to sign up page/form
      </li>
      <li><strong>Curriculum Page</strong>: includes various coding languages being offered by the company</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Initial sketches are below. Click on any one of them to see the images at full size.</p>
    <div class="image-gallery">
      <div>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/sketch1.png">
          <div class="gallery-preview" style="background-image: url('imgs/sketch1.png');"></div>
        </a>
      </div>
      <div>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/sketch2.png">
          <div class="gallery-preview" style="background-image: url('imgs/sketch2.png');"></div>
        </a>
      </div>
      <div>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/sketch3.jpg">
          <div class="gallery-preview" style="background-image: url('imgs/sketch3.jpg');"></div>
        </a>
      </div>
      <div>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/sketch4.jpg">
          <div class="gallery-preview" style="background-image: url('imgs/sketch4.jpg');"></div>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>After creating our initial sketches, we compared each other&#39;s ideas and consolidated them into a final
      wireframe that contained the layouts that we like most.</p>
    <p>We chose the design elements in the pages seen below for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Home Page</strong>: In general, the goal we had in mind while designing this page was to get the user
        to apply to Strive School. Therefore, we made the &quot;Apply Now&quot; button very prominent: center on the
        screen and large in size. A person browsing the home page will likely only be on the page for a short while, so
        we put impressive statistics and prestigious companies on this page to succinctly provide flattering information
        to the user. </li>
      <li><strong>Admissions Page</strong>: A timeline in Admissions page helps prosepctive students have a clear
        understanding of the admission process and be more confident on the sequence of steps for applying to the
        program.</li>
      <li><strong>Curriculum Page</strong>: To give prospective students a broad overview of the technologies taught by
        courses in Strive School, we decided to list each topic out as cards grouped by curriculum track/focus. Clicking
        on each card would reveal more information about the respective technology (not implemented in the wireframe).
        We also wanted to emphasize that students could have choice in their Strive School learning experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Figma for final wireframe: </p>
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450"

      allowfullscreen></iframe>



    <h2 id="high-fidelity-hi-fi-mockup">High Fidelity (Hi-fi) Mockup</h2>
    <p>Using our wireframe above, we got to work to create a hi-fi prototype of the webpage. We added additional pages
      to provide more information to the user, settled on a color scheme, and used varying font sizes and weights to
      draw the user&#39;s attention to certain aspects of the site. </p>

      allowfullscreen></iframe>


    <h3 id="mockup-critique-from-studio">Mockup Critique from Studio</h3>
    <p>Next, we presented our hi-fi prototype to other students and an industry critic in our studio for UIUX (CSCI
      1300) by giving context for Strive School and walking through each page.</p>
    <p>We collected the following points of feedback from our peers and industry critic.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&#39;Apply Now&#39; form should be a popup instead of modal so that users don&#39;t have to leave the page
        that they&#39;re on</li>
      <li>Make sure that &#39;Sign Up&#39; page is GDPR compliant</li>
      <li>Allow users with accounts to log in; provide some sort of link or button for this</li>
      <li>Make the curriculum card modals scrollable</li>
      <li>Add more information/context on what Strive School is</li>
      <li>Add an About Us page</li>
      <li>Emphasize on home page and throughout website what differentiates Strive School from other coding bootcamps
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="revised-hi-fi-prototype">Revised Hi-fi Prototype</h3>
    <p>With the feedback from the Studio Critique in mind, we updated our hi-fi prototype with the following revisions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a new &#39;Sign In&#39; page, and renamed the Apply Now button in the navbar to &#39;Sign In&#39;</li>
      <li>Added an &#39;About Us&#39; page to give the startup more credibility</li>
      <li>Added a new section on the homepage to detail Strive School&#39;s unique business model</li>
      <li>Added additional checkboxes to &#39;Sign Up&#39; page to better comply with GDPR</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="user-testing">User Testing</h2>
    <p>To get a final round of feedback on our website prototype, we set up and executed user tests for 3 testers
      through the website <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a>.</p>
    <p>Each test in UserTesting consists of a scenario, which gives context to testers before they interact with the
      prototype, and a series of tasks that the testers perform and give audio feedback on.</p>
    <h3 id="testing-setup">Testing Setup</h3>
    <p>Scenario: </p>
    <p>This interactive website prototype (NOT a real website) was created for a coding bootcamp startup, Strive School.
      A coding bootcamp is an intensive program that prepares students for entry-level software development careers. We
      want to inform prospective students on why Strive School is unique and why students should apply. Imagine you are
      someone who is interested in starting a new career in software engineering without going through a traditional 4
      year university. **This is not an actual website but an interactive mockup made on prototyping software.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Task 1: Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial impressions of the website? Explain your answer.
      </li>
      <li>Task 2: Imagine you are interested in starting an application to Strive School. Find the admissions process
        and navigate to a page where you can create a Strive School account.</li>
      <li>Task 3: Take as much time as you need to explore this website. Move on to the next task when you&#39;re ready.
      </li>
      <li>Task 4: Go to Google and find one other company that offers a similar service. Compare the two websites. State
        at least 2-3 differences. Which did you prefer? Why?</li>
    </ul>
